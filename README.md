## Key Benefits

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: The widget is built with a modular architecture, allowing for easy customization and extension.
- **Accessible Modal Dialog**: The modal dialog is accessible, with ARIA attributes and focus trapping.
- **Customizable Content**: The widget supports multiple languages and allows for custom content in the modal and notices.

## Accessibility

The widget is designed with accessibility in mind. The modal dialog includes ARIA attributes to ensure that it is accessible to all users. The modal is also focus-trapped to prevent users from tabbing outside the modal. The badge and modal are keyboard accessible, and the modal can be closed using the escape key.

## Svelte as a Framework

The widget is built using Svelte, a modern web framework that compiles to highly optimized vanilla JavaScript. Svelte is a great choice for building web components and widgets due to its simplicity and performance. The widget is compiled to a standalone JavaScript file that can be easily included in any website.
